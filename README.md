# AoC2023day1
Advent of Code 2023 day 1 challenge

The task here is to go through an array and find the first and last digit in each array element, concatenate these to make a
two digit number (i.e. 235 = 25), and then sum all the numbers. Each element contains both digits and letters.
In the second part you have to also first find digits in the element that appear in the array elements in text (i.e. one3five2 = 1352), 
and then proceed as before - take the first and last digit, concatenate these and then sum all numbers.
